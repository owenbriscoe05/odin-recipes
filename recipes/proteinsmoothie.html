    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The best part about protein smoothies is their freedom of choice. I'm 
        going to suggest my personal choice of fruit, peanut butter, etc, but you
        can easily adjust to your own preference. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Protein smoothies are a great choice post-workout, but are also a great way
        to simply make a tasty drink more nutritional. When you hear "protein smoothie"
        you probably just think of a fruit smoothie with protein powder added, but 
        most enjoyers of this snack will make extra additions that distinguish it further.
